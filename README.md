# Geo-Data
Geologists frequently deal with geochemical data while conducting mineral exploration. Different rock types will affect the statistical background populations, and therefore it is imperative to separate the geochemical data into distinct sub-populations according to their listed rock type. Prior to statistical analysis, certain corrections must be made to raw geochemical data entered by geologists. The project will aim to prepare the data for analysis by running several sequential scripts to modify numerical values, followed by a function that separates each sample by its major rock type and analyzes the population statistics of each rock type group. Finally, the results of this parsing will be displayed in violin plots with each separate rock type, as well as all rock types, receive their own plot on the display. The process is to be captured in a Jupyter notebook where a geologist can upload files, select numeric corrections, and generate the plots with different modules.
